> Concept of distribution, Univariate and multivariate distributions, Conditional and Marginal distributions

In the phase of processing and analyzing the data collected, the statistician uses a set of tools to gather as much as information as possible from the sample of units studied.\\ Given a data set, you may want to start counting how many occurrencies are there for every specific value (or a set of it) that a variable might assume. This is called *relative frequiency* for that specific value (or set) and we can present this info as a fraction (number of occurrencies over the total set of objects observed) or as a percentage of the sample population. If we compute the relative frequency for every possible value of a single variable, then we obtain the so called *univariate distribution*. A statistical distribution describes how values are distributed for a field. In other words, the statistical distribution shows which values are common and uncommon.\\
We might do the exact same passages but starting from the *joint frequency* of $n$ different attributes: we count the number of occurrencies where all the $n$ attributes where observed on the single unit at the same time. Defining all the possible joint frequencies we will obtain the *multivariate distribution*. Here we can see an example for $n= 2$ (*bivariate distribution*):\

To represent a multivariate distribution we need a matrix that has a dimension for every variable we are considering.\
The *Marginal distribution* of the $k$-variate has the distribution of all the minors distributions (from $1$ to $k-1$) summing on the $k-th$ column.\
