### Inferential statistic
In the inferential statistics we want to study an unknown popolation starting from a known sample. We have to levels:

+ Theorical: the level of the unknown and of what we want to determine informations
+ Empirical: the known level in which we find the empirical sample

In the emirical level we can do observation and measures, compute the frequency and obtain an empirical distribution of a general attribute $X$.
The inference induction is the process of determine the probability starting from the frequence of an attribute $X$.

In the theoretical layer, for each attribute $X$ there's a theoretical distribution (that might be continous or descrete).

$$
f(X):\mathbb{O}(S)\to\mathbb{R}
$$

Where $f$ is called density function if is continous or is called probabilty function if is descrete.

In general we assume that $Pr\[(x, dx)\]=f(x)dx$ and $P(A)=\int f(A)dx$.
Another approach is defining $F(X)=Pr\{\}$
