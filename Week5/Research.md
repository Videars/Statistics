### Statistics meaning

There are multiple meanings for the word statistic:

+ Science viewed as a discipline
+ Graphics and charts
+ Any function of the observed data $f(D)$

In either way, his aim is to syntesize a population aspect to a number and capture a specific characteritic of the data set

$$
S: D \to \R
$$

## Mean

We can define the mean of a random variable X as $mean(X)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i}{n}$.
If we group the $x_i$ by their occurrencies we than obtain:
$$
mean(X)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i n_j}{n}
$$

and since $\frac{n_j}{n}=f_j$ is the frequency of the $j-th$ variable then:

$$
mean(X)=\sum_{j=1}^{k}x_j f_j
$$
