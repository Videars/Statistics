> Paralles between the properties of the relative frequency and the axioms for probability measure. Discuss some concrete examples of measure space. Illustrate how measure theory provides the mathematical foundation for probability.

The Relative frequency has some basic properties:

+ $0\leq f_A \leq 1$
+ $f_{A \cup B} = f_A + f_B $ in case $A$ and $B$ are disjoint
+ $f_{A \cup B} = f_A + f_B - f_{A \cap B}$
+ f( \emptyset ) = 0
+ f(P) = 1

Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur.

These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory, which is used widely in areas of study such as statistics, mathematics, science, finance, gambling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science, game theory, and philosophy to, for example, draw inferences about the expected frequency of events.

### Golmogorov Axioms

The assumptions as to setting up the axioms can be summarised as follows: Let $(\Omega, F, P)$ be a measure space with $P(E)$ being the probability of some event $E$, and $P(\Omega )=1$. Then $(\Omega, F, P)$ is a probability space, with sample space $\Omega$, event space $F$ and probability measure $P$.

#### First axiom

The probability of an event is a non-negative real number:

$P(E)\in \mathbb {R} , P(E)\geq 0\qquad \forall E\in F$ where $F$ is the event space. It follows that $P(E)$ is always finite, in contrast with more general measure theory. Theories which assign negative probability relax the first axiom.

#### Second axiom

This is the assumption of unit measure: that the probability that at least one of the elementary events in the entire sample space will occur is $1$

$P(\Omega )=1$

#### Third axiom
This is the assumption of Ïƒ-additivity:

Any countable sequence of disjoint sets (synonymous with mutually exclusive events) $E_{1},E_{2},\ldots$ satisfies $P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty }E_{i}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}P(E_{i})$.

### Probability Space examples

$(\Omega , \epsilon, p)$ in case of ** COIN TOSS **:

$\Omega = \\{ T, C \\} $

$\epsilon = \\{ \Omega, \emptyset , T, C, \bar{T}, \bar{C}, T \cup C, T \cap C \\} $
